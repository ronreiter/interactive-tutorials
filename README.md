To run locally, first create a new file called `app.env` based on `app.env.example`.
(you don't need working credentials to run the website, just to execute code).

### Running with Docker

Execute:

    DEFAULT_DOMAIN=learnpython.org make run

This command will run learnpython.org website by default using Docker Compose.

To run a specific website, run with the DEFAULT_DOMAIN option set, as follows:

    DEFAULT_DOMAIN=learn-js.org make run

By default, the server process will run at http://localhost:5000.

The web server will locally compile and load all Markdown files into memory. The docker needs to be rebuilt upon any change in the Python code or the Markdown code.

### Running without Docker (locally)

To run the development server outside of a Docker, run the following command once: 

    make build-local

And then run:

    DEFAULT_DOMAIN=learn-js.org make run-local
    

### IDEOne Credentials

To make the IDEOne execution API work locally, you must obtain a username and password, 
and add the credentials to a file called app.env.
(TBD: add an option to use the remote version)
