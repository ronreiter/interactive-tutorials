Tutorial
--------
 
Recursion occurs when a function contains within it a call to itself. Recursion can result in very neat, elegant code that is intuitive to follow. It can also result in a very large amount of memory being used if the recursion gets too deep.
 
Common examples of where recursion is used :
 
* Walking recursive data structures such as linked lists, binary trees, etc.
* Exploring possible scenarios in games such as chess
 
Recursion always consists of two main parts. A terminating case that indicates when the recursion will finish and a call to itself that must make progress towards the terminating case.
 
For example, this function will perform multiplication by recursively adding :

    #include <stdio.h>

    unsigned int multiply(unsigned int x, unsigned int y)
    {
        if (x == 1)
        {
            /* Terminating case */
            return y;
        }
        else if (x > 1)
        {
            /* Recursive step */
            return y + multiply(x-1, y);
        }
 
        /* Catch scenario when x is zero */
        return 0;
    }

    int main() {
        printf("3 times 5 is %d", multiply(3, 5));
        return 0;
    }
 
Exercise
--------
 
Define a new function called `factorial()` that will compute the factorial by recursive multiplication (5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1). Note that by convention, the factorial of 0 is equal to 1 (0! = 1).
 
Tutorial Code
-------------

    #include <stdio.h>

    /* define your function here (don't forget to declare it) */

    int main() {
        /* testing code */
        printf("0! = %i\n", factorial(0));
        printf("1! = %i\n", factorial(1));
        printf("3! = %i\n", factorial(3));
        printf("5! = %i\n", factorial(5));
    }
 

Expected Output
---------------

    0! = 1
    1! = 1
    3! = 6
    5! = 120

Solution
--------

    #include <stdio.h>

    int factorial(int number);

    int main() {
        /* testing code */
        printf("0! = %i\n", factorial(0));
        printf("1! = %i\n", factorial(1));
        printf("3! = %i\n", factorial(3));
        printf("5! = %i\n", factorial(5));
    }

    int factorial(int number) {
        if (number > 1) {
            return number * factorial(number-1);
        }
        else {
	           return 1;
        }
    }
