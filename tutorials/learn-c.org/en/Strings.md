### Defining strings

Strings in C are actually arrays of characters. Although using pointers in C is an advanced subject, fully explained later on, we will use pointers to a character array to define simple strings, in the following manner:

    const char * name = "John Smith";

This method creates a string which we can only use for reading. 
If we wish to define a string which can be manipulated, we will need to define it as a local character array:

    char name[] = "John Smith";

This notation is different because it allocates an array variable so we can manipulate it. The empty brackets notation `[]` tells the
compiler to calculate the size of the array automatically. This is in fact the same as allocating it explicitly, adding one to 
the length of the string:

    char name[] = "John Smith";
    /* is the same as */
    char name[11] = "John Smith";

The reason that we need to add one, although the string `John Smith` is exactly 10 characters long, is for the string termination:
a special character (equal to 0) which indicates the end of the string. The end of the string is marked because the program
does not know the length of the string - only the compiler knows it according to the code.

### String formatting with printf

We can use the `printf` command to format a string together with other strings, in the following manner:

    const char * name = "John Smith";
    int age = 27;

    /* prints out 'John Smith is 27 years old.' */
    printf("%s is %d years old.\n", name, age);

Notice that when printing strings, we must add a newline (`\n`) character so that our next `printf` statement will print in a new line.

### String Length

The function 'strlen' returns the length of the string which has to be passed as an argument:

    const char * name = "Nikhil";
    printf("%d\n",strlen(name));        

### String comparison

The function `strncmp` compares between two strings, returning the number 0 if they are equal, or a different number if they are different.
The arguments are the two strings to be compared, and the maximum comparison length. There is also an unsafe version of this function
called `strcmp`, but it is not recommended to use it. For example:

    const char * name = "John";

    if (strncmp(name, "John", 4) == 0) {
        printf("Hello, John!\n");
    } else {
        printf("You are not John. Go away.\n");
    }

### String Concatenation

The function 'strncat' appends first n characters of src string to the destination string where n is min(n,length(src));
The arguments passed are destination string, source string, and n - maximum number of characters to be appended. For Example:

    char dest[20]="Hello";
    char src[20]="World";
    strncat(dest,src,3);
    printf("%s\n",dest);
    strncat(dest,src,20);
    printf("%s\n",dest);

Exercise
--------

Define the string `first_name` with the value `John` using the pointer notation, and define the string `last_name` with the value `Doe`
using the local array notation.

Tutorial Code
-------------

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    int main() {
      /* define first_name */
      /* define last_name */
      char name[100];

      last_name[0] = 'B';
      sprintf(name, "%s %s", first_name, last_name);
      if (strncmp(name, "John Boe", 100) == 0) {
          printf("Done!\n");
      }
      name[0]='\0';
      strncat(name,first_name,4);
      strncat(name,last_name,20);
      printf("%s\n",name);
      return 0;
    }


Expected Output
---------------

    Done!
    JohnBoe

Solution
--------

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include <string.h>
    int main() {
      const char * first_name = "John";
      char last_name[] = "Doe";
      char name[100];

      last_name[0] = 'B';
      sprintf(name, "%s %s", first_name, last_name);
      if (strncmp(name, "John Boe", 100) == 0) {
          printf("Done!\n");
      }
      name[0]='\0';
      strncat(name,first_name,4);
      strncat(name,last_name,20);
      printf("%s\n",name);
      return 0;
    }
