Tutorial
--------
Perl is an interpreted high-level programming language developed by Larry Wall. It is the Swiss Army knife of scripting languages.

Perl programming can be accomplished by directly executing perl commands at the shell prompt or by storing them in a text file, and then executing it as a Perl script.


Exercise
-------------
Use the print command to print the line "Hello, World!". Note that the new line character "\n" should be used in order to print a new line.

Tutorial Code
-------------
	#!/bin/bash
	# Text to the right of a '#' is treated as a comment - below is the perl command
	print "Goodbye, World!\n";

Expected Output
---------------
	Hello, World!

Solution
---------------
print "Hello, World!\n";
