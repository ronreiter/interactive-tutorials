# Welcome

Welcome to the learnsqlonline.org free interactive SQL tutorial.

SQL (pronouned either as S-Q-L or Sequel) is a powerful language for querying and analyzing any amount of data in the world.
It is the most important tool for developers, analysts and data scientists alike for being able to deal with data.

SQL is commonly used for Business Intelligence so companies can make operative decisions on how to act based on data generated by the business. It is also
used for researching data to create new insights by aggregating vast amounts of data. In the new big-data era, it is now possible to query petabytes of
data using a single query using novel data warehouse technologies (for example: Hadoop, Spark, BigQuery, Presto/Amazon Athena, and more).

SQL can also be used to construct long-running data pipelines and process data for business purposes - Spark is a great example of a technology that utilizes
SQL syntax to create data pipelines that can continuously process large amounts of data and turn it into another form of useful data, either for insights
or for generating new data out of existing data.
