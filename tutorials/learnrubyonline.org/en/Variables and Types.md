Tutorial

A variable is a named piece of data. You can use a variable to store a value within your program, and refer to it later by the variable name. 

Variables are defined using `=`:

    myFirstVariable = "I made a variable!"

Once you have assigned a value to a variable, you can then refer back to it:

    puts myFirstVariable

There are three main types of variable:

- Strings (a collection of characters inside quotation ("" or '') marks)
- Booleans (true or false)
- Numbers (numeric values)

    my_string = "I'm a string!"
    my_boolean = true
    my_number = 42

Exercise
--------

Define three variables, `my_string`, `my_boolean`, and `my_number`, and set them to "I'm programming!", "true", and "5".

*** Omit the quotation marks on boolean & number
