One of the most basic tasks in any programming language is to display information to the user. To print something to the console so the user can see it, use `puts`.

    puts "I will be printed to the console!"

Everything between the quotation marks will be printed to the console. 

You can use either single (`'`) or double (`"`) quotation marks with `puts`, as long as you are consistent.

Instead of writing `puts`, you can use the shorter form, `p`.

    p 'Hello world'

You can also use `print` to display information. The difference between `puts` and `print` is that when you use the `puts` keyword, Ruby adds a newline(' \\n ') at the end. Ruby does not do this with `print`.

    puts 'Hello World !!!'
    Hello World !!!
    => nil

     print 'Hello World !!!'
     Hello World !!!=> nil
