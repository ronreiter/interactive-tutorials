Tutorial
--------

Strings are variables that hold text. For example, a string which contains a name is defined as follows:

    $name = "John";
    echo $name;

We can easily format strings using variables. For example:

    $name = "John";
    $introduction = "Hello $name";
    echo $introduction;

We can also concatenate strings using the dot `.` operator. For example:

    $first_name = "John";
    $last_name = "Doe";
    $name = $first_name . " " . $last_name;
    echo $name;

To measure the length of a string, we use the `strlen` function:

    $string = "The length of this string is 43 characters.";
    echo strlen($string);

To cut a part of a string and return it as a new string, we can use the `substr` function:

    $filename = "image.png";
    $extension = substr($filename, strlen($filename) - 3);
    echo "The extension of the file is $extension";

### Joining and splitting

We can join arrays to form strings, or split strings to arrays of strings.

For example, to split a string with a list of fruits separated by a comma, we use the `explode` function:

    $fruits = "apple,banana,orange";
    $fruit_list = explode(",", $fruits);
    echo "The second fruit in the list is $fruit_list[1]";

To join back an array to a single string separated with commas, we use the `implode` function:

    $fruit_list = ["apple","banana","orange"];
    $fruits = implode(",", $fruit_list);
    echo "The fruits are $fruits";

Exercise
--------

Split string that contains the list of numbers into a new array called number_list and then rejoin the number_list array into a single string separated with colons(:) .

// TODO: split the $numbers variable to an array
// called $number_list

print_r($number_list);

// TODO: rejoin the number_list array into a colon separated single string 
// called $numbers_colon

print_r($numbers_colon)
?>
