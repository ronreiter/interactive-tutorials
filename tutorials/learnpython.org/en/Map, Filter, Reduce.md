--------
Map, Filter, and Reduce are paradigms of functional programming. They allow the programmer (you) to write simpler, shorter code, without neccessarily needing to bother about intricacies like loops and branching.

Essentially, these three functions allow you to apply a function across a number of iterables, in one fell swoop. ```map``` and ```filter``` come built-in with Python (in the ```__builtins__``` module) and require no importing. ```reduce```, however, needs to be imported as it resides in the ```functools``` module. Let's get a better understanding of how they all work, starting with ```map```.

#### Map
The ```map()``` function in python has the following syntax:

```map(func, *iterables)```

Where ```func``` is the function on which each element in ```iterables``` (as many as they are) would be applied on. Notice the asterisk(```*```) on ```iterables```? It means there can be as many iterables as possible, in so far ```func``` has that exact number as required input arguments. Before we move on to an example, it's important that you note the following:

1. In Python 2, the ```map()``` function returns a list. In Python 3, however, the function returns a ```map object``` which is a generator object. To get the result as a list, the built-in ```list()``` function can be called on the map object. i.e. ```list(map(func, *iterables))```
2. The number of arguments to ```func``` must be the number of ```iterables``` listed. 

Let's see how these rules play out with the following examples.

Say I have a list (```iterable```) of my favourite pet names, all in lower case and I need them in uppercase. Traditonally, in normal pythoning, I would do something like this:

    my_pets = ['alfred', 'tabitha', 'william', 'arla']
    uppered_pets = []

    for pet in my_pets:
        pet_ = pet.upper()
        uppered_pets.append(pet_)

    print(uppered_pets)

Which would then output ```['ALFRED', 'TABITHA', 'WILLIAM', 'ARLA']```

With ```map()``` functions, it's not only easier, but it's also much more flexible. I simply do this:

    # Python 3
    my_pets = ['alfred', 'tabitha', 'william', 'arla']

    uppered_pets = list(map(str.upper, my_pets))

    print(uppered_pets)

Which would also output the same result. Note that using the defined ```map()``` syntax above, ```func``` in this case is ```str.upper``` and ```iterables``` is the ```my_pets``` list -- just one iterable. Also note that we did not call the ```str.upper``` function (doing this: ```str.upper()```), as the map function does that for us on _each element in the ```my_pets``` list_.

What's more important to note is that the ```str.upper``` function requires only **one** argument by definition and so we passed just **one** iterable to it. So, _if the function you're passing requires two, or three, or n arguments_, then _you need to pass in two, three or n iterables to it_. Let me clarify this with another example.

Say I have a list of circle areas that I calculated somewhere, all in five decimal places. And I need to round each element in the list up to its position decimal places, meaning that I have to round up the first element in the list to one decimal place, the second element in the list to two decimal places, the third element in the list to three decimal places, etc. With ```map()``` this is a piece of cake. Let's see how.

Python already blesses us with the ```round()``` built-in function that takes two arguments -- the number to round up and the number of decimal places to round the number up to. So, since the function requires **two** arguments, we need to pass in **two** iterables.

    # Python 3

    circle_areas = [3.56773, 5.57668, 4.00914, 56.24241, 9.01344, 32.00013]

    result = list(map(round, circle_areas, range(1, 7)))

    print(result)

See the beauty of ```map()```? Can you imagine the flexibility this evokes?

The ```range(1, 7)``` function acts as the second argument to the ```round``` function (the number of required decimal places per iteration). So as ```map``` iterates through ```circle_areas```, during the first iteration, the first element of ```circle_areas```, ```3.56773``` is passed along with the first element of ```range(1,7)```, ```1``` to ```round```, making it effectively become ```round(3.56773, 1)```. During the second iteration, the second element of ```circle_areas```, ```5.57668``` along with the second element of ```range(1,7)```, ```2``` is passed to ```round``` making it translate to ```round(5.57668, 2)```. This happens until the end of the ```circle_areas``` list is reached.

I'm sure you're wondering: "What if I pass in an iterable less than or more than the length of the first iterable? That is, what if I pass ```range(1, 3)``` or ```range(1, 9999)``` as the second iterable in the above function". And the answer is simple: nothing! Okay, that's not true. "Nothing" happens in the sense that the ```map()``` function will not raise any exception, it will simply iterate over the elements until it can't find a second argument to the function, at which point it simply stops and returns the result.

So, for example, if you evaluate ```result = list(map(round, circle_areas, range(1, 3)))```, you won't get any error even as the length of ```circle_areas``` and the length of ```range(1, 3)``` differ. Instead, this is what Python does: It takes the first element of ```circle_areas``` and the first element of ```range(1,3)``` and passes it to ```round```. ```round``` evaluates it then saves the result. Then it goes on to the second iteration, second element of ```circle_areas``` and second element of ```range(1,3)```, ```round``` saves it again. Now, in the third iteration (```circle_areas``` has a third element), Python takes the third element of ```circle_areas``` and then tries to take the third element of ```range(1,3)``` but since ```range(1,3)``` does not have a third element, Python simply stops and returns the result, which in this case would simply be ```[3.6, 5.58]```. 

Go ahead, try it.

    # Python 3

    circle_areas = [3.56773, 5.57668, 4.00914, 56.24241, 9.01344, 32.00013]

    result = list(map(round, circle_areas, range(1, 3)))

    print(result)


The same thing happens if ```circle_areas``` is less than the length of the second iterable. Python simply stops when it can't find the next element in one of the iterables. 

To consolidate our knowledge of the ```map()``` function, we are going to use it to implement our own custom ```zip()``` function. The ```zip()``` function is a function that takes a number of iterables and then creates a tuple containing each of the elements in the iterables. Like ```map()```, in Python 3, it returns a generator object, which can be easily converted to a list by calling the built-in ```list``` function on it. Use the below interpreter session to get a grip of ```zip()``` before we create ours with ```map()```

    # Python 3

    my_strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    results = list(zip(my_strings, my_numbers))
    
    print(results)

As a bonus, can you guess what would happen in the above session if ```my_strings``` and ```my_numbers``` are not of the same length? No? try it! Change the length of one of them.

Onto our own custom ```zip()``` function!

    # Python 3

    my_strings = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
    my_numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    results = list(map(lambda x, y: (x, y), my_strings, my_numbers))

    print(results)

Just look at that! We have the same result as ```zip```. 

Did you also notice that I didn't even need to create a function using the ```def my_function()``` standard way? That's how flexible ```map()```, and Python in general, is! I simply used a ```lambda``` function. This is not to say that using the standard function definition method (of ```def function_name()```) isn't allowed, it still is. I simply preferred to write less code (be "Pythonic").

That's all about map. Onto ```filter()```

#### Filter
While ```map()``` passes each element in the iterable through a function and returns the result of all elements having passed through the function, ```filter()```, first of all, requires the function to return boolean values (true or false) and then passes each element in the iterable through the function, "filtering" away those that are false. It has the following syntax:

```filter(func, iterable)```

The following points are to be noted regarding ```filter()```:

1. Unlike ```map()```, only one iterable is required.
2. The ```func``` argument is required to return a boolean type. If it doesn't, ```filter``` simply returns the ```iterable``` passed to it. Also, as only one iterable is required, it's implicit that ```func``` must only take one argument.
3. ```filter``` passes each element in the iterable through ```func``` and returns **only** the ones that evaluate to true. I mean, it's right there in the name --  a "filter".

Let's see some examples

The following is a list (```iterable```) of the scores of 10 students in a Chemistry exam. Let's filter out those who passed with scores more than 75...using ```filter```.

    # Python 3
    scores = [66, 90, 68, 59, 76, 60, 88, 74, 81, 65]

    def is_A_student(score):
        return score > 75

    over_75 = list(filter(is_A_student, scores))

    print(over_75)

The next example will be a palindrome detector. A "palindrome" is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same backwards as forwards. Let's filter out words that are palindromes from a tuple (```iterable```) of suspected palindromes.

    # Python 3
    dromes = ("demigod", "rewire", "madam", "freer", "anutforajaroftuna", "kiosk")

    palindromes = list(filter(lambda word: word == word[::-1], dromes))

    print(palindromes)

Which should output ```['madam', 'anutforajaroftuna']```. 

Pretty neat huh? Finally, ```reduce()```

#### Reduce
```reduce``` applies a function **of two arguments** cumulatively to the elements of an iterable, optionally starting with an initial argument. It has the following syntax:

```reduce(func, iterable[, initial])```

Where ```func``` is the function on which each element in the ```iterable``` gets cumulatively applied to, and ```initial``` is the optional value that gets placed before the elements of the iterable in the calculation, and serves as a default when the iterable is empty. The following should be noted about ```reduce()```:
1. ```func``` requires two arguments, the first of which is the first element in ```iterable``` (if ```initial``` is not supplied) and the second element in ```iterable```. If ```initial``` is supplied, then it becomes the first argument to ```func``` and the first element in ```iterable``` becomes the second element.
2. ```reduce``` "reduces" (I know, forgive me) ```iterable``` into a single value. 

As usual, let's see some examples.

Let's create our own version of Python's built-in ```sum()``` function. The ```sum()``` function returns the sum of all the items in the iterable passed to it.


    # Python 3
    from functools import reduce

    numbers = [3, 4, 6, 9, 34, 12]

    def custom_sum(first, second):
        return first + second

    result = reduce(custom_sum, numbers)
    print(result)


The result, as you'll expect is ```68```.

So, what happened?

As usual, it's all about iterations: ```reduce``` takes the first and second elements in ```numbers``` and passes them to ```custom_sum``` respectively. ```custom_sum``` computes their sum and returns it to ```reduce```. ```reduce``` then takes that result and applies it as the first element to ```custom_sum``` and takes the next element (third) in ```numbers``` as the second element to ```custom_sum```. It does this continuously (cumulatively) until ```numbers``` is exhausted. 

Let's see what happens when I use the optional ```initial``` value.


    # Python 3
    from functools import reduce

    numbers = [3, 4, 6, 9, 34, 12]

    def custom_sum(first, second):
        return first + second

    result = reduce(custom_sum, numbers, 10)
    print(result)


The result, as you'll expect, is ```78``` because ```reduce```, initially, uses ```10``` as the first argument to ```custom_sum```.


That's all about Python's Map, Reduce, and Filter. Try on the below exercises to help ascertain your understanding of each function.
